I am an Honors Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Colorado Boulder. On top of my major, I am also pursuing minors in Engineering Management and Engineering Entrepreneurship. Outside of my academics, I am a Powertrain Engineer for the CU Formula SAE team, as well as an active member within the Engineering Honors Program.

I have become passionate about CAD modeling, and how it can be applied in industry. I have signifigant experience using applications such as SOLIDWORKS and OnShape to design mechanical parts. I also have mastery of engineering drawing techniques, as well as Bill of Material implementation. I have used this skill to design not only part files, but also fully-mated assemblies ready for manufacture.

In addition, I have several years of applied coding experience in languages such as Python, Java, MATLAB, JavaScript, and LaTeX. I have leveraged this coding background within my role as a co-founder for Declassify.ai, a student-made and run website designed to improve course registration at the university using an AI agent. I was responsible for front-end UI development for the website, as well as driving all seed funding and investor pitch meetings.

I am interested in applying this CAD knowledge and coding background within the engineering industry to automate processes and design required subsystems. As I move towards the workforce, I aim to apply these skills within an organization that can help me design and build these systems per industry standards.
